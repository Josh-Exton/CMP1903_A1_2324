code review from Harry Paul

Have the requirements been met?

At the time of writing testing functionality was commented out and thus wasn't functional

The main program rolls 3 dice and sums the total, however the brief states that the additional rolls should be part of the game class not the program class

Does the code follow the style guide?

code follows the style guide with methods and variables being in the appropriate cases

Is the code easy to read?

code is thoroughly commented and easy to read

Are different errors handled correctlty?
yes i guess



additional notes:
I don't understand the purpose of the rolledNumber variables, why not use the public Num value of the die class directly?

If you make the random object static you don't need to force a pause into your program. i just put "private static readonly Random randomNumber = new Random();" at the top of my die class and that worked.

instead of instantiating the die class everytime the play function is called to reroll the die, use the roll function
